## System & Environment Tools

The following tools are installed as part of the Termux environment setup:

- **Node.js**: [MIT](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/LICENSE)
- **Golang**: [BSD-3-Clause](https://go.dev/LICENSE)
- **FFmpeg**: [LGPL-2.1+](https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html)

- **Git**: [GPL-2.0](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/COPYING)
- **jq**: [MIT](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/blob/master/COPYING)
- **tmux**: [ISC License](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/master/COPYING)

## Compliance & Limitations

- **Commercial Redistribution**: Usage of **n8n** is governed by the *Sustainable Use License*. While free for personal and internal business use, it restricts commercial reselling or embedding n8n as a paid service without an Enterprise license.
- **Copyleft**: Components licensed under **GPL/LGPL** (like FFmpeg, git, termux-services) are used as external tools in the environment. This toolkit's logic (shell scripts) is "merely aggregated" with these tools and is not a derivative work that would trigger copyleft requirements under standard usage.
